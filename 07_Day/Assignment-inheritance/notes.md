if (dateOfBirth > today.AddYears(-age)) age--;



- This line **adjusts the age** if the person hasn't had their birthday yet in the current year.

#### How it works:
- `today.AddYears(-age)` gives the person's birthday in the **current year**.
  - Example: `today = 2025-07-21`, `age = 22`  
    → `today.AddYears(-age)` = `2003 + 22` → `2025-06-10`

- Now it checks:
  - If `dateOfBirth` (like `2003-06-10`) is **after** `2025-06-10` (i.e., their birthday hasn’t happened yet this year),
  - Then it subtracts 1 from the calculated age.

#### Example:
- `dateOfBirth = 2003-12-01` (December)
- `today = 2025-07-21`
- `age = 2025 - 2003 = 22`
- `today.AddYears(-22)` = 2003-07-21
- Since `2003-12-01` > `2003-07-21`, birthday not yet reached → age becomes `21`

### 🟩 Summary:
This code ensures **accurate age** calculation by:
1. Subtracting years.
2. Adjusting if the person hasn’t celebrated their birthday yet this year.

Let me know if you want to refactor this logic into a read-only property instead.
