1.  Design an algorithm to accept 10 integer elements for an array and then
rearrange the elements in the
array in reverse order. The reversed array must be displayed as output.
2.  Design an algorithm which accepts a set of N (consider N to be 30) student's
examination marks (in the range of O to 100). Then make a count of the number
of students that obtain each possible mark
3.  Design an algorithm which accepts a set of N (consider N to be 30) student's
examination marks (in the
range of O to 100). Then make a count of the number of students that obtain
each possible mark (i.e.;
count of how many students scored O, count of how many students scored 1,
till count of how many
students scored 100)
Activity 5:
Modify the algorithm written in Activity 4 in order to get count of students in a
specific range of marks
as defined below.
Range of marks:
O to 1096
91% to 100%

4.  Get 3 max and min elements of the array
5. Sum of array elemets

## **Create an Employee Class with following specification:**
1. Employee name as String
2.Basic Salary ,HRA, DA, TAX, Gross Pay and Net Salary as decimal.
3. Calculate the HRA(15% of Basic salary), DA(10% of Basic Salary), GrossPay(Basic Salary+HRA+DA), TAX(8% of Gross Pay) and Net pay(Gross Pay - Tax)
4.A constructor to allow to define the Employee Name and Basic Salary
5. A method  CalculateNetpay to calculate the HRA, DA, TAX, Gross and Net Pay values using critria mentioned in Point 4.
6. A method Display to display salary structure.
